##Confluence Revamp / Revamped themes for Kodi

These are themes for the default skin Confluence for Kodi.
The idea behind this theme is to update the images while improving the overall "look & feel" a job that was started to fix pixelated images, precision issues (half pixels), colour matching, elements alignments/centering and sizing.

It was originally intended to be a full replacement for the default theme, but as it happens it turned up it was simpler to make it a theme.  

#### What should you expect to see changed. 

While some changes are subtle there are many complete redesigns.    
Not a detailed list, though you can see a quick comparison of whats been done so far.

###### :memo: Notes:
Nothing is overwritten in the default skin. This is fully and immediately reversible should you not like the changes.
For systems like android/similar you will need to have a way to write to system folders. i.e. root

***Compatibility:*** These themes are fully compatible with any Confluence skin versions and most skin mods out there. Some skin mods use these themes as default.  
Feel free to download the themes from here to ensure you are using the most up-to-date textures for your preferred skin mods.
