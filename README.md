:ledger: For themes you can include a color.xml and a wallpaper.jpg named same as the <filename>.xbt in these paths.
```
someskin.here\backgrounds\mytheme.jpg
someskin.here\colors\mytheme.xml
someskin.here\media\mytheme.xbt
```
 
Place the resulting <filename>.xbt and other files as above and change the theme via Settings > Appearance > Skin
