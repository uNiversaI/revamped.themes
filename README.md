##Confluence Revamp Skin For XBMC

This is the Default skin for XBMC, with some Texture fixes and color matching.
This fixes pixelated images, precision issues (half pixels), color matching (using Confluence Blue #0084ff, elements alignments/centering and sizing.
This usually happens when new graphics are needed and they are added done using raster resources which are often resized and various people add new graphics with no access to psd sources.
