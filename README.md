##Confluence Revamped themes for Kodi

These are themes for the default skin Confluence for Kodi.
The idea behind this theme is to update the images to improve the overall "feel" and to fix pixelated images, precision issues (half pixels), color matching, elements alignments/centering and sizing.
It was originally intended to be a full replacement for the default textures, but as it happens it turned up it was simpler to make it a theme.

#### What should you expect to see changed. 

Most changes are subtle however they are as follows. (some have beem merged into main skin)

#### Contributing

I would be honoured and extremely thankful if you decided to submit PR back for the improvements and changes you make or new PSD's you make yourself.

#### Notes
Nothing is overwritten in the default skin. This is fully and immediately reversible should you not like the changes.
For systems like android/similar you will need to have a way to write to system folders. i.e. root

#### Recruiting
I am looking for python coder to help make/improve a [script/addon] (https://github.com/uNiversaI/confluence.extras.downloader) for automatic theme/background/weather art downloading and installing.
